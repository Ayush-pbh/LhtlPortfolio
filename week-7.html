            <h3 class="sub-heading">INQUIRY</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text"><i>Asking questions is the greatest show of respect to a speaker.</i></p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Inquiry-based learning is more than asking an understudy what the individual in question needs to know. It's tied in with setting off interest. What's more, actuating an understudy's interest is, I would contend, an undeniably more significant and complex objective than simple data conveyance. Inquiry Based Learning places the obligation regarding learning on the understudies, and urges them to show up at a comprehension of ideas without help from anyone else.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-heading">Structured Inquiry</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text">As communicated coordinated solicitation is a sort of enquiry where understudy follow the lead of the teacher as the entire class participates in on enquiry together in this kind of learning understudies don't have to glance through a ton as the instructor gives all the material to help understudies with finding an ordinary outcome the upsides of this kind of solicitation is that there is a basically no degree of dissatisfaction in achieving the outcome and help the understudies with understanding the meaning of joint effort.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="sub-heading">Controlled Inquiry</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text">In this kind of solicitation teacher picks the subjects and recognizes the resources that understudy will use to address the requests the kind of solicitation limits the examination power of the understudies and makes them a book nut this similarly achieves lower collaboration among understudies and instructor as the understudies endeavor to mug up every one of the thoughts and proposition the right reactions rather than curious with regards to the request.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="sub-heading">Guided Inquiry</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text">
                In this kind of solicitation educator picks the subject/questions and the understudy plan thing for conditions. This sort of solicitation is more established on the investigating the request and endeavoring to find the fitting reaction instead of looting up everything and allowing each understudy to use their own particular manner of learning .It essentially triggers the understudies mind to think fundamentally which prompts self-headway.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">Free Inquiry</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text">
                Free solicitation in which understudy pick their subjects without reference to any embraced result this sort of enquiry give the most incredible environment to the understudy to learn on the foundation of solicitation. it is essentially a personal development measure for each individual. free solicitation allows every individual to fathom and learn on their own learning rate and frameworks
